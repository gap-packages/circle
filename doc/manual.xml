<Abstract>

<Index Key="Circle package">&Circle; package</Index> 
The &GAP;4 package &Circle; extends the &GAP; functionality 
for computations in adjoint groups of associative rings.
It provides functionality to construct circle objects that will 
respect the circle multiplication <M> r \cdot s = r + s + rs </M>, 
and to compute adjoint semigroups and adjoint groups of finite rings.
Also it may serve as an example of extending the &GAP; system with 
new multiplicative objects.
