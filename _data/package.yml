abstract: |
    The <span class="pkgname">Circle</span> package provides functionality for computations in adjoint groups of finite associative rings. It allows to construct circle objects that will respect the circle multiplication r*s=r+s+rs, create multiplicative groups, generated by such objects, and compute groups of elements, invertible with respect to this operation. Also it may serve as an example of extending the GAP system with new multiplicative objects.
